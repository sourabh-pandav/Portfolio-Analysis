What is the Portfolio Analysis?
Portfolio Analysis is one of the areas of investment management that enable market participants to analyze and assess the performance of a portfolio (equities, bonds, alternative investments, etc.), intending to measure performance on a relative and absolute basis along with its associated risks.

Steps to Portfolio Analysis
1 – Understanding Investor Expectation and Market Characteristics Prior to doing a portfolio analysis, it is important to match up investor expectations with the market where such assets will be invested. The portfolio aim is greatly aided by the investor's expectations being in line with the risk, return, and market aspects. Fund manager B has outperformed other managers with a greater information ratio.

2 - Developing a strategy for asset allocation and deployment. This is a scientific procedure that contains personal prejudices. It is critical to specify the types of assets that will be included in the portfolio, the instruments that will be used to analyze the portfolio, the benchmarks to which the portfolio will be compared, the frequency of such performance measurements, and other details.

3 - Assessing Performance and Making Adjustments as Needed The performance of the portfolio will be examined and assessed after the time period specified in the previous stage, in order to ascertain if the goals for the portfolio were achieved and to identify any necessary corrective measures. Additionally, any modifications to the investor's goals are taken into account to keep the portfolio analysis current and the investor's expectations in check.

The Workings of Portfolio Analysis
You've probably heard the saying "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" before. The correlation theory in portfolio analysis is based on this. The value of your portfolio might be destroyed by unfavorable developments if all of your securities move in the same way in reaction to market occurrences. (It should be noted that the same portfolio can experience a large increase in reaction to favorable circumstances.)

Making sure that all of your assets are spread throughout a variety of economic sectors is the definition of "not putting all your eggs in one basket." In other words, a lack of connection between your securities is a good thing. As a result, they do not all react to an event by moving in the same direction.

Some securities may suffer when a negative development (like COVID) occurs (stocks of airline companies for example). While others could succeed (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds). Additionally, the value of the portfolio as a whole can hold.

Risk is decreased while portfolio returns are optimized in this fashion.

Selecting good securities is just one part of portfolio analysis; choosing the appropriate assets for your portfolio is another.

But this approach to investing is not totally reliable. During the Financial Crisis of 2008–2009, most assets correlated. In reaction to the crisis, the value of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, gold, commodities, derivatives, and real estate all decreased.

The best strategy we are aware of for raising success rates and minimizing risk is still to reduce the correlation between the assets in a portfolio.
